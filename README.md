# Fillit
  Project were you have to assemble given tetriminos set altogether to smallest possible square.
  Could be optimized for example checking first which is the minimun square instead of starting from 2x2 square and
  instead of starting to put tetrimino to the square and then if it doesn't fit delete it you could first just check is it possible
  to fit the tetrimino
